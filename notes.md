There exists a package called `base` which is the base package.  ;)

# equivalence exercises

1. It has a free variable of z.  can't be c because that only has 1 arg

normal form is the end result of a computation / expression after all beta
reductions have been done

combinator  = lambda term with no free variables

identity function is a combinator

omega  is a diverging lambda function ie an infinite loop

((lambda (x) (x x) (lambda (x) (x x)))

this is the 'omega' infinite loop

combinators:

1. yes
2. no
3. yes
4. yes
5. no


divergence:

1. converges
2. diverges
3. converges
